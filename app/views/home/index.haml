              Tim Ellis, a drummer from St. Paul, Minnesota, has a long history with drums. He has been playing in bands of all genres for over 35 years, while along the way collecting vintage drums. Way back when they weren't called vintage. Rumor has it, Tim opened a shop because he needed a place to store his ballooning collection.

              Tim makes his own line of drums with the Ellis Drum Company line. Production is done right in the shop basement. Tim employs pro drummers in the shop so they know and understand things from a drummer's point of view. Friendly and quality service is a must.
